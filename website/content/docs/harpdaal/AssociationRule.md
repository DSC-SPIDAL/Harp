title: Association Rule 
---

Association rule learning is a rule-based learning method for discovering relations between variables in databases. 
It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness.

Harp-DAAL support a Batch mode of Association Rules based on the *Apriori* algorithm [^fn1]. provided by
