title: Moments of Low Order
---

Moments are basic quantitative measures of data set characteristics such as location and dispersion. 
We compute the following low order characteristics: minimums/maximums, sums, means, sums of squares, sums of squared differences from the means, second order raw moments, variances, standard deviations, and variations.

Harp-DAAL supports the distributed mode of Low-order moments for both of dense and sparse (CSR format) input datasets
