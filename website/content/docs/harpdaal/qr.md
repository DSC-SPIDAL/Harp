title: QR Decomposition 
---

The QR decomposition or QR factorization of a matrix is a decomposition of the matrix into an orthogonal matrix and a triangular matrix. A QR decomposition of a real square matrix A is a decomposition of A as A = QR, where Q is an orthogonal matrix (its columns are orthogonal unit vectors meaning Q<sup>T</sup>Q = I) 
and R is an upper triangular matrix (also called right triangular matrix).

Harp-DAAL currently supports distributed mode of QR for dense input datasets.
