Decision forest classification and regression algorithms are based on an ensemble of tree-structured classifiers (decision trees) 
built using the general technique of bootstrap aggregation (bagging) and random choice of features.

Harp-DAAL currently supports batch mode of Decision Forest for dense input datasets, which includes two sub-types

* Classification
* Regression
