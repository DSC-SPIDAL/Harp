---

Outlier detection methods aim to identify observation points that are abnormally distant from other observation points. 

## Univariate 

A univariate outlier is an occurrence of an abnormal value within a single observation point.

## Multivariate

In multivariate outlier detection methods, the observation point is the entire feature vector.

Harp-DAAL currently supports batch mode of outlier detection for dense input datasets.
